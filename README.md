# Tracker-GPS-RasPi4
Real time tracker with raspberry pi 4

This is a project created by ESIME, IPN students

Â¡Be very careful with the physical connections as we do not want to cause damage to our RasPi4!

API's such as "PUBNUB" and "Google Maps" are used in their free version, for a better experience it is necessary to pay for the use of these, currently (01/21/2021) the approximate cost of both is $ 2.0 USD.
